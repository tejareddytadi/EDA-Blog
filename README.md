# **Decoding Health Patterns: Unveiling Predictive Insights through EDA**

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a synthetic healthcare dataset to uncover important patterns and predictive insights. The analysis involves identifying trends, relationships between health indicators, and visualizing the data to derive meaningful conclusions.

The dataset is meticulously generated using the `Faker` library, simulating a diverse set of healthcare scenarios. The project aims to explore various aspects of healthcare dynamics using EDA techniques and statistical visualizations.

## **Project Overview** ðŸŒŸ

This project explores **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the healthcare domain, uncovering patterns in patient profiles such as age, BMI, blood pressure, physical activity, and more. Through EDA, we aim to extract meaningful insights that can guide predictions and further analysis in the healthcare space.

Key features of this project include:
- Handling missing values
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships between features
- Detecting outliers and data inconsistencies
- Analyzing categorical and numerical health-related features

The blog attached to this project, titled **"Decoding Health Patterns: Unveiling Predictive Insights through EDA"**, provides a step-by-step breakdown of the EDA process on healthcare data.

## **Dataset** ðŸ“Š

The dataset consists of 1,500 synthetic entries, with attributes reflecting patient health profiles, including:
- Patient ID
- Gender
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Smoking Status
- Physical Activity Level
- Total Cholesterol Level
- Diagnosis (e.g., Healthy, Chronic Disease, Acute Condition)
